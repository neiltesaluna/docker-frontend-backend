We can spin up the frontend service using: `> docker-compose start frontend-service`  
to spin up the backend service we can use: `> docker-compose start backend-service`  
  <br />

### Accessing these services on the browser  

The host for both these services run on **IP 0.0.0.0**  
The frontend service is using **PORT 5000**  
The backend service is using **PORT 5001**  
  
The access frontend service http://0.0.0.0:5000
